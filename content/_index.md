          In the <u>D</u>esign <u>I</u>nnovation & <u>G</u>enerative <u>I</u>n<u>t</u>elligence (DIGIT) Lab, we study **how AI can design better materials, structures, and machines**. Our research focus extends beyond model performance and efficiency, exploring how AI can fundamentally advance design across four key dimensions: 

          1. **Complexity:** How can AI unlock design complexities that are fundamentally inaccessible to traditional methods?
          2. **Trustworthiness:** How can we develop AI-driven design methodologies that engineers can trust?
          3. **Discoverability:** How can AI discover new knowledge that expands human understanding and guides design innovation? 
          4. **Creativity:** How can AI enable or accelerate the discovery of "out-of-the-box" design solutions and become a true inventor?

          Guided by these fundamental questions, we develop computational methodologies for design ideation, generative design, and design for X ("X" can represent manufacturing, sustainability, reliability, and beyond) across diverse engineering domains.
